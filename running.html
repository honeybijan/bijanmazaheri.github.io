    <h2>About Me</h2>
    In addition to being a Ph.D. student, I am also a competetive runner! A question I get a lot is how I balance both parts of my life. I like to think of running and research as more of a symbiosis than a balancing act. I often think about my research problems while running and find that exercise helps me see problems from different perspectives. I'll return from runs excited to try out new ideas I had while coming down the mountain. On the flip side, my life as a researcher helps keep me from taking my training too seriously. Running isn't my job, so I try to keep it fun!
